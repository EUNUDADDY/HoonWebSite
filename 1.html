  <p>We are pleased to announce today that W3C is to become a public-interest non-profit organization.<br>
The design of the new legal entity has been taking several years because of the imperative to preserve the core mission
of the Consortium to shepherd the web by developing open standards with contributions from W3C Members, staff, and the
international community. </p>

  <p style="margin-top:80px;">In the months leading to the launch of a new legal entity in January 2023,
we will release further details. Please find more information in our media advisory about the original Hosted model
that is being replaced and what it helped W3C accomplish in 28 years, the reasons for change and why we must preserve
our standards development process, and our next steps.</p><br>
